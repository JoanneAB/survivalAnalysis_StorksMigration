# A survival analysis on migratory return dates of white storks to Alsace, France

## Description

This study applies survival analysis to model the time until the first white stork observation of the
year in Alsace, using data collected across the region. Survival times are defined as the number of days
from the start of the year until the first stork is observed. Weather data as well as lunar phase information
are used as covariates to explain the variability in return dates.

## How to use it

Data and python code are available to generate the dataset.

R script is available to proceed with the survival analysis.
